Skywhale
========

Spice up any webpage with the infamous Canberra Skywhale by [Patricia Piccinini](http://www.patriciapiccinini.net/). See here for more details: [The Skywhale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Skywhale).

Originally developed as an easter egg in a [GovHack](http://www.govhack.org/) 2013 project: [100 Years 100 Stories](http://2013.hackerspace.govhack.org/?q=groups/100-years-100-stories).

Usage
---

1) Include skywhale.js in your page.
```
<script src="skywhale.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
2) launch the skywhale with JavaScript. The 1000 below represents the time (in milliseconds) between the Skywhale disappearing off screen and the next one being spawned - the default is 2000 if left empty.
```
<script type="text/javascript">
  skywhale.launch(1000);
</script>
```
